### `StockSummaryDisplay` Component Refactor

- **Objective**: Restructure the stock summary component to have a consistent layout on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Action Taken**:
  - Modified the `StockSummaryDisplay` component in `nvda-risk-chart/src/components/StockRiskChart.tsx`.
  - Changed the main container's flexbox layout from `md:flex-row` to a consistent `flex-col` for all screen sizes.
  - Centered all content to ensure a uniform appearance.
  - Organized the elements into a clear, single-column layout:
    1.  **Top**: Company name and ticker/price.
    2.  **Middle**: Risk score and description.
    3.  **Bottom**: Risk color legend bar.
- **Reasoning**: The previous layout had a different structure for desktop and mobile, which the user wanted to unify. This change simplifies the code and provides a more consistent user experience.
- **File(s) Modified**:
  - `nvda-risk-chart/src/components/StockRiskChart.tsx`

### Mobile Touch-Drag Refinement (Scrolling Fix)

- **Objective**: Re-enable vertical page scrolling when a touch gesture starts on the chart, while preserving the horizontal drag-to-zoom functionality.
- **Action Taken**:
  - In `nvda-risk-chart/src/components/StockRiskChart.tsx`, modified the inline style of the chart's container `div`.
  - Changed the `touchAction` CSS property for mobile devices from `'none'` to `'pan-y'`.
- **Reasoning**: The previous setting, `touchAction: 'none'`, was too restrictive and completely disabled the browser's native scrolling on the chart element. By changing it to `touchAction: 'pan-y'`, we explicitly allow the browser to handle vertical panning (scrolling). This works in tandem with our JavaScript gesture-detection logic, which calls `e.preventDefault()` only on horizontal drags, creating an intuitive experience where vertical swipes scroll the page and horizontal drags zoom the chart.
